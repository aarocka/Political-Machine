# Political-Machine
This is a machine that takes a guess at your political affiliation.
It uses the power of python, docker, and possibly the power of the cloud or some shit idk.

# How this works
The basic concept is to ask a series of basic questions. The net will predict your political affiliation and you are given the option to correct it. ????? Profit!!!
